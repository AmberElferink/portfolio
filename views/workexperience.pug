                          |Amber assisted me in various computer science modules for pupils from upper secondary education as part of the U-Talent programme at the Utrecht University. She helped the pupils during practical exercises and used her thorough knowledge of Arduino development, Unity, Sonic Pi and Processing in a very constructive, friendly and supportive way. Especially her proactive approach was valued by both me and the pupils.

                          Amber has worked with me as a student assistent in a short course for high school students about making projects with Arduino's and electrical components. With little help, Amber got to know the material beforehand (ie. building projects with the Arduino). Amber showed interest in the course and aligned her own approach to students with the goals and didactics. She was punctual, proactive in helping students and communicative concerning to where she did and didn't have the knowledge to help. So all in all: a great addition to the teaching team!

        p.
          Filling the time between bachelor and master, I worked on the Ditou table at Fair2Media. 
          Fair2Media is a small company with total of 5 people (excluding me). 
          The Ditou table is an interactive table where a beamer projects a map of real places via Unity. 
          On this map, you move round disks as a cursor to place objects such as windmills and solar panels.
          The round disks are tracked by a camera above the table. 
          My responsibility was to develop a new tracking algorithm for round disks on the Ditou table (C++ and OpenCV), and to make an environment in Unity loading, customizing and saving the map. 
          Thereby, by using the tracked positions, 3D windmills and solar panels could be built on the map. Before I started, there was a table, a camera and a beamer. The previous solution they had, used infrared lights on battery charged disks to track them.
          So the entire tracking and also the map projection on the table was built from the ground up.
          The tracking and Unity environment communicated via NodeJS. 
          The table is currently used to demonstrate the outcomes for building windmills and solar panels for citizensâ initiatives.

          |The Werfkracht project was built to get students in touch with education. It consists of working an average of four hours a week on diverse activities for secondairy school students.
          |Examples are: 
          ul 
            li Translating the Kangaroo Mathematics competition for the visually disabled. 
            li Helping organize and assisting at conferences such as the Woudschoten Chemie beurs and Research Funding Days.
            li Assisting in multiple U-talent workshops. The U-talent courses are available for secondary school students that perform outstandingly well and want to take additional lessons in a wide variety of subjects. 
               | This includes the Arduino, Simulation and games and Music programming workshops below.
               | Below I will highlight some of the projects I worked on.

                    In this workshop secondary school students learn the fundamentals of Arduino. On day one they learn the basics by doing three projects from the Arduino starters kit book.
                    After gaining some experience, they think of a project they want to make. 
                    They come up with amazing ideas like a "high five robot", laser vault protection system, velocity sensor or infra red remote controlled robots.
                    At home, they start working on their ideas in the online Tinkercad environment. On the second day, they build their projects and solve the remaining bugs.
                    It is always a joy to help in these workshops, since after this workshop they have built something amazing, while they generally have never programmed before.

                    This workshop teaches secondary school students with generally no programming experience to make simulations and games with the Unity engine. 
                    As a preparation the students follow the Unity tutorials. 
                    On the first day they make a rabbit population simulator by adding random movement, collision, reproduction and death. 
                    A predator and food is then added to the simulation.
                    They think about a simulation or game they want to make at home and start working on it. They finish it the second workshop day.
                    During these workshops I guided students as a teaching assistent.

                    In music programming, secondary school students learn programming, by programming their own song. 
                    In Sonic Pi they learn the basic principles of loops, methods and threads. It uses a programming language based on Ruby.
                    To accompany their song, they also program an animation in Processing, which touches briefly on classes. 
                    This is a programming language related to Java.
                    After these workshop, they have made a full music video using code.

                  p.card-text.
                    Since I have done the chemistry bachelor, I also assisted in chemistry practicals.
                    The gas chromatography (GC) practical was designed to enthuse secondary school students about chemistry.
                    Secondary schools usually do not have expensive apparatus such as a GC. 
                    To give them experience with that, two students from Utrecht University are given a rental car and the equipment.
                    They drive to the school, set up the equipment and give a presentation on the subject of catalysis and GC.
                    The students then have a palladium, platinum, copper catalysts and as a control only the support: aluminium oxide. 
                    They then test how well these catalysts work for burning methane by looking at the end products with the GC.
                    With one other student I transported the GC with equipment by rental car, and installed it at the secondary school. 
                    We presented, assisted students with the measurements and answered students with questions.
