              I'm Amber and I absolutely love learning.  Recently I discovered a great interest in Virtual Reality and haptics, which makes the user experience the forces of the virtual world.
              Since this is a young technology, I feel there is a lot to be done. I decided I want to be a part of the pioneers that connect that world to ours.
              In my spare time, I'm trying to develop a haptic device for the legs.
          p.
              After I finished my chemistry bachelor I decided I wanted to continue my studies, so I started a computer science bachelor. 
              Although I love chemistry, by studying computer science I have found an even greater passion. 
              I have always been interested in programming computers, robots and Arduino's and my aim is now to significantly further my knowledge on this subject.
          p.
              Before the haptic exoskeleton will be brought to life, I have a lot to learn.
              And since I love learning, that seems like a great thing to do!

                          |Amber assisted me in various computer science modules for pupils from upper secondary education as part of the U-Talent programme at the Utrecht University. She helped the pupils during practical exercises and used her thorough knowledge of Arduino development, Unity, Sonic Pi and Processing in a very constructive, friendly and supportive way. Especially her proactive approach was valued by both me and the pupils.

                          Amber has worked with me as a student assistent in a short course for high school students about making projects with Arduino's and electrical components. With little help, Amber got to know the material beforehand (ie. building projects with the Arduino). Amber showed interest in the course and aligned her own approach to students with the goals and didactics. She was punctual, proactive in helping students and communicative concerning to where she did and didn't have the knowledge to help. So all in all: a great addition to the teaching team!
