          I'm Amber and I absolutely love learning. After finishing my chemistry bachelor, I decided I was not done studying yet, and started a computer science bachelor.
          I thought I loved chemistry, but studying computer science, I have found an even greater love.
          I have always been interested in programming computers, robots and Arduino's and want to learn everything there is to know about it.

          Recently I discovered a great interest in Virtual Reality and haptics, which makes the user experience the forces of the virtual world.
          Since this is a young technology, I feel there is a lot to be done. I decided I want to be a part of the pioneers that connect that world to ours.
          In my spare time, I'm trying to develop a haptic device for the legs. Before that will be brought to life, I have a lot to learn.
      p.
          And since I love learning, that seems like a great thing to do.
