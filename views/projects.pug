                    | Wat if we were to make an exoskeleton for the entire body, that can be tilted as well?
                    | We would be able to simulate anything in VR. Walk, step onto things, step in a plane and fly away. 
                    | Feel all the forces in a virtual world.
                    | I spent a few weeks doing research and designing ideas to solve the locomotion problem with haptic feedback in my spare time.
                    | Since this project I tried to fully customize my education to work towards this goal.
                    | Designing an exoskeleton counteracting human movements is hard due to the high torque and speed requirements for the motors.
                    | Another problem is that you should be able to move without the motor counteracting your forces.
                    | Both of these difficulties prove to be most challenging for the legs.
                    | The research I have during this time is downloadable in a PDF below. 
                    | Please keep in mind that during this time I only had chemistry and 1.5 years computer science experience.

                    | I never fully finished it, since there were some (solvable) issues with both electronics and welding.
                    | Thereby, I had to start my master which left little time to spend entire days in the workshop.

                      | Aside from working on computers, I like working with my hands. 
                      | Since pockets for women are usually too small to fit a phone, wallet and keys, I made this to solve that problem.
                      | I wear it on my belt every day.
                      | I first made the design to fit my keys, wallet and phone exactly, and then I added decorations.
                      | I bought vegetable tanned leather, stamped, cut and dyed it, after which I have sewn it together by hand.
                      | I have received a lot of positive feedback on this project and have even been approached by strangers to create a similar bag for them.
